        <div id="o1text"> <strong> EDUCATION </strong> </div>
            <div id="o1body"> I graduated from University of California, Berkeley (Go Bears!) with degrees in Psychology and Creative Writing. My passion for games reflected in my academics; I wrote a literature review on the therapeutic effects of ADHD, and I was proudly a student instructor for the Visual Narratives and Storytelling DeCal class for two years. There, I taught students the critical vocabulary to analyze visual media (movies, comics, games, etc.) and worked with a group of 3-7 students to successfully complete a creative project every semester. Beyond academics, I’ve also held board positions in Game Design and Development at Berkeley and Cal Marginalized Genders in Gaming. In both, I sought to empower underrepresented groups in gaming via organizing game jams, participating in student game projects, and connecting students to industry professionals.  </div>
        <div id="o2text"> <strong> WRITER </strong> </div>
            <div id="o2body"> Whether it’s scripting a comic or storyboarding a game, I adore writing visual narratives. All my experiences have also emphasized to me that my work flourishes when I work with others. Consequently, becoming a professional Dungeon Master/Game Master (check out my GM-ing resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/186g3NrnZOFE6AaMFkFx7xUKK8HiuVLzm/view?usp=sharing" id="gmresume"> here! </a>) seemed natural to me and founded a lot of the values I carry into my creative process. Building worlds and characters collaboratively as well as developing resonant player experiences was incredibly fulfilling for me. Beyond TTRPGs, I’ve written video games, scripts, short stories—and I’m always looking to build on my craft. As a student instructor for Visuals Narratives and Storytelling, I’ve been lucky to share my knowledge and help other students develop their craft, as well. I’ve won awards in the New Suns Fiction contest, the <em> Chrysalis of Guesses </em> AAPI zine, and was a finalist in Berkeley’s Undergraduate Immigration:Creative Media Prize. Most importantly, I believe in the power of collaborative storytelling and play as a vehicle for creative growth. Good stories don’t just entertain–they empower. I’ve been inspired by the writers who’ve mentored me in my creative process, and I hope to build a career that’ll allow me to do the same for other marginalized students.             </div>
        <div id="o3text"> <strong> RESEARCHER </strong> </div>
            <div id="o3body">While at Berkeley, I was the Project Director for Dr. Kristin Luker, Professor Emerita of Berkeley Law and Sociology, where I coordinated research across internal and external stakeholders. Previously, I was a research intern for Berkeley Law’s Center of Reproductive Rights and supported a midwifery program at Mills College. These experiences led me to becoming a legal intern at Doo & Chong Attorneys at Law, where I was lucky to work with local, AAPI-led businesses in my community. To support businesses I grew up with—ones which connected me to my Chinese-American heritage—highlighted to me the goal of research is to turn theory into practice. Consequently, my research experiences equipped me with the ability to convey complex, technical information and how to effectively manage a project. Most importantly, these experiences emphasized to me the nuances across interactions, within academia and within games, and I bring the same perspective into every space I enter.</div>
        <div id="o4text"> <strong> HOBBIES! </strong> </div>
            <div id="o4body">In my spare time, I make bread! Seriously. I just love creating, from practicing new sourdough recipes to painting sardine cans. If I’m not making something, then I’m researching. Whether it’s Wikipedia/library deep-dives to asking experts what plants would thrive in my turtles’ aquarium, I adore understanding the world around me.</div>
