<div id="gtitle"> <strong>TABLETOP GAMES CAN BE ABOUT ANYTHING</strong> </div>

<div id="posdt"> <strong> WRITER, GAME DESIGNER | JULY 2023 - PRESENT </strong> </div>

<div id="sum"> <em> As I began my internship at Ubisoft, I wanted to continue writing. I decided every two weeks, I would identify one real life activity and try to translate it into a brief tabletop roleplaying game. This was an exercise in my ability to adapt narrative to mechanics and testing those mechanics out in play. Additionally, as I began full-time work as an Ubisoft intern, it was a good way to test how I could manage my time while creating concise, resonant work. </em> 
PLAY HERE: COMING SOON.

<div id="goals"> <strong> GOALS </strong></div>

<div id= "list"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> Deepen my understanding of what makes a game mechanic effective and how (and when!) narrative can be incorporated into it. </li>
        <li> Get better at surveying and incorporating player feedback. </li>
        <li> Have a fun project to de-stress from work! </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="respon"> <strong> RESPONSIBILITIES </strong> </div>
    <div id= "list"> 
        <ul> 
            <li> Converting real-life activities into game mechanics and developing narratives alongside those mechanics.  </li>
            <li> Reviewing and adjusting my personal writing process to effectively manage time and streamline project workflow for 1 game per 2 weeks.   </li>
            <li>Playtesting and reviewing player feedback to brainstorm how to improve mechanic(s).  </li>
            <li> Writing flavor text, character customization, and instruction text. </li>
            <li> Developing playtesting questions and presenting feedback to collaborate with players to create more engaging game mechanics. </li>
            <li>Scoping mechanics and setting gameplay goals (i.e. emotions this mechanic should evoke) to determine effectiveness. </li>
            <li> Researching relevant activities (i.e. picnicking & cryptid hunting) and tabletop-games to determine what would constitute effective play. </li>

    <div id="tooltitle"> <strong> TOOLS </strong> </div>
    <div id="list"> <ul> 
        <li> Notion (workflow and time management) </li>
        <li> Google Suite (Calendar, Slides, Jamboard, Sheets, Forms) </li>
        <li> Discord (playtester recruitment) </li>
        <li> Procreate </li>

<div id="respon"> <strong> WHAT I LEARNED  </strong> </div>

<div id= "list2"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> <strong> 1. Anything can really be a TTRPG—at a cost. </strong> My big takeaways are scope and time. Sometimes, the cost is taking away from the realism or rescoping your game to be smaller. Thinking about my Minimum Viable Product has always helped me in past game projects, but I realized now, I could afford to be more ambitious. Setting deadlines is helpful for moving the project along, but a deadline doesn’t mean that’s when I stop working on a specific project. Editing was a skill I honed in this process. Not just incorporating feedback, but learning how to give myself more effective feedback and time management, as I balance full time work and my creative projects. </li>
        <li> <strong> 2. The note behind the note. </strong> Feedback is always useful and asking clarification questions behind their comments can be effective, as well. After a couple iterations on my picnicking game, I realized players kept mentioning how the “packing” mechanic felt unfulfilling, but they had no idea how it could improve. Instead, I focused on how that mechanic made them feel. Was that feeling addressing my gameplay and narrative goals? I realized sometimes, when a comment addresses one issue explicitly, it might be tied to one neither of us are consciously aware. Realizing I should celebrate the progress I made and take a break to re-center myself helped my productivity immensely. </li>
        <li> <strong> 3. Breaks help time management. </strong> As I started my internship at Ubisoft, I realized a couple weeks in I wasn’t spending as much time writing as I used to. I’ve tracked personal projects before via Notion, but I realized I was just running out of steam. </li>
    </ul>
