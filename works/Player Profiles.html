<div id="posdt"> <strong> WRITER, RESEARCHER | JUN 2022 to PRESENT (HIATUS) </strong> </div>

<div id="sum"> <em> During my time as a paid Game Master (GM), I encountered a wide variety of players. It got me thinking—what were the general trends among their playstyles? More importantly, how could I create better (and more empowering!) worlds for them to engage with? To improve my collaborative storytelling skills and better craft narratives for my players, I began surveying them about safety tools and documenting what I’ve observed. </em> </div>

<div id= "list"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> Develop safer, more compelling play by implementing safety features. </li>
        <li> Determine which safety features were effective and the various pros/cons while using them. </li>
        <li> Improve how I gather feedback from my players and how I incorporate them. </li>

        <ul> 
            <li> Solicit and incorporate feedback across 5 groups of players.</li>
            <li> Worked with 3 other GMs to offer thoughtful feedback and iterate on safety tool implementation during play.</li>
            <li> Researched various safety tools and developed methods to implement them. 
            <li> Observed player reactions and table dynamics. </li>
            <li> Generated 5 player profiles, anticipating what style of play they would enjoy and what risks they may pose in collaborative play. </li>

<div id= "list2"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> <strong> 1. Defining “better play.” </strong>  Specifically, what each player considers enjoyable play and what they prioritize in it. Knowing these player profiles meant I could focus on creating a story my players enjoyed. Whether it was a political thriller or a dungeon crawl, better play meant different things to each party I worked with. Knowing what they expected and what they would consider improvements was vital to improving my own work. </li>
