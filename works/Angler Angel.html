<div id="respon"> <strong> WHAT I LEARNED  </strong> </div>

<div id= "list2"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> <strong> 1. Have the hard conversations. </strong> Making a game isn’t easy. As college seniors facing our final round of theses and capstone projects, the team struggled to produce our first slice; we re-scoped Angler Angel three times. By having the hard conversations about our commitment to the game and what we realistically could accomplish meant we eased a lot of stress and tension from the team. It allowed us to work more effectively and, more importantly, built stronger teamwork.</li>
        <li>  <strong> 2. Do post-mortems </strong> Understanding what went wrong was vital to making sure our future actions flowed smoothly. We worked to discuss this as a group, and I ensured each conversation was civil and productive. Editing and feedback is a vital part of completing any project, so sitting down with the team and understanding why we took each step was a great learning experience.  </li>
    </ul>
