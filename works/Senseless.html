<div id="respon"> <strong> WHAT I LEARNED  </strong> </div>

<div id= "list2"> 
    <ul> 
       <li> <strong> 1. Over-communication is better than under-communicating </strong> In a 23-person team, it’s easy for one team to not really understand what another is doing. As a result, I realized talking about everything I did and all my concerns would be more helpful than not talking at all. It was a process that allowed us to address a lot of bugs and story issues early on, helping us connect gameplay and narrative more closely. </li> 
       <li> <strong> 2. One page pitches will save your life </strong> Since the team was so large, having a concise summary of what we planned to do was vital to keep tasks moving smoothly. I began preparing central documents for the entire writing team and encouraging other teams to do the same. </li>
    </ul>
