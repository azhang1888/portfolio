<div id="gtitle"> <strong>ADAPTATION EXERCISE</strong> </div>

<div id="posdt"> <strong> WRITER | JUNE 2023 to PRESENT </strong> </div>

<div id="sum"> <em> Teaching visual storytelling for two years meant I’m incredibly familiar with how different visual mediums convey stories. To test my skills on adaptation and see the different challenges unique to each medium, I outlined a general story and wrote a short story. Then, I rewrote it as a script, a comic, and finally a game.  </em> </div>

<div id="goals"> <strong> GOALS </strong></div>

    <ul> 
        <li> 1. Hone my skill in adapting a story across different mediums.  </li>
        <li> 2. Explore how different mediums can utilize separate features to emphasize different parts of a narrative. </li>
        <li> 3. Outlining the same story across multiple mediums; determine what makes an effective outline for a novel versus a game.         </li>

<div id="respon"> <strong> WHAT I LEARNED  </strong> </div>

<div id= "list2"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> <strong> 1. Identify core themes and characteristics. </strong> Outlines have truly saved me multiple times during this project. I’ve always sought to think “visually” while writing, considering how my writing could convert to art or gameplay, but outlines kept me focused on the core character arcs, plotlines, and themes I wanted to convey. Even when I wanted to change certain scenes, recognizing what my work identified with helped me stay consistent while adapting. </li>
        <li> <strong> 2. Know your medium. </strong> As a Visual Storytelling & Narratives instructor while at UC Berkeley, I had a pretty good grasp about different mediums going into this project. However, I realized I was approaching issues I never thought of. I began consuming much more comics, games, movies, etc. just to critically think about how each medium conveyed their point. I found myself asking, “Was it effective or not effective? Why not? What would I do differently?” after each watch. It emphasized the unique features of each medium and developed my mindset on how to think visually. Which leads to the next point… </li>
        <li><strong> 3. Ask experts! </strong> I’m lucky to be surrounded by passionate, talented writers, artists, and designers who are more than happy to talk to me about their favorite mediums. They can recommend good pieces of visual media for me to analyze and advise me on how to approach certain scenes. </li>
    </ul>
