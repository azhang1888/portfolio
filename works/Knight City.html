<div id= "list2"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> <strong> 1. Your playtesters are also your collaborators! </strong> As I began playtesting more stringently, I realized a lot of comments my (awesome) playtesters left were also ideas on how to iterate on my mechanics. Playtesting to me has always been a Google Form with a list of survey questions, a process I was incredibly familiar with from my research background, but when I brought my playtesters into the development process—I saw my games flourish in ways I didn’t expect. It was so creatively rewarding to be offered a different perspective on my games and to hear what they were interested in playing. </li>
