<div id= "list2"> 
    <ul> 
        <li> <strong> 1. Documentation. </strong> Even though the team was relatively small, that didn’t mean we were immune to confusion. Keeping clear documentation of each change, with agreed upon narrative and gameplay goals, meant everyone on the team was up to date with the state of the game. This became especially vital with our deadline rapidly approaching; we didn’t have the time to brief everyone if we didn’t read the documentation. Also, just having text to reference if you were tired or unsure was life-saving. </li>
